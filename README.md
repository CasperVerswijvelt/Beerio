# Beerio - Beer browser for IOS

Beerio, simply put, is an app that allows you to store all of the information about your favourite beers in one place: this app. Beerio allows you to browse an online database of beers (BrewereyDB) and save these individual beers to your local library. On the other hand if a beer is not available in the database, you are able to 'create' a beer yourself and store it in your personal library. After adding some beers to your personal beer library, you can place notes on them.
